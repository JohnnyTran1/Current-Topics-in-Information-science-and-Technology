My thoughts on the microservices architecture (MSA) is that, especially in our modern society, 
it is able to push the boundaries for software systems with its disruptive features like its better scalability and agility; 
This is enough for companies to transition from the traditional monolithic software. 
Although the thought of MSA being able to effortlessly add and update parts of the system without disrupting is fascinating, 
this may be more troubling than its worth when transitioning to it. I think when looking from the management’s perspective, 
companies huge and small must evaluate the opportunity cost of switching to microservices 
and whether or not it’s worth the time & resource to develop it in the first place. As a person who’s pursuing a minor in finance, 
the main problem with microservices for these companies is that it's just a dramatic change to their system, the costs simply might outweigh the benefits. 
Every company is different so it doesn’t imply to them because “Netflix, Amazon and Twitter, which adopted it to support their ever- increasing traffic volumes and 
their competitive requirements to continuously deliver new features and capabilities. Most organizations don’t have to deal with Netflix-level scalability concerns but 
they do need to deliver new features more quickly”. (Page 4) So unless companies need to support their CD practice, typically companies who have a big presence in the 
internet with online services & products value scalability and agility the most. Overall, I personally don’t think it's a big leap forward to be adapted by most 
businesses because “by 2022, 70% of organizations that attempt to adopt microservices will have found the effort too disruptive and will have switched to miniservices 
instead”. (page 2) While many praise the value of the microservices, it overshadow the significance of miniservices; 
This is due to the fact, miniservices is a less extreme version of microservices and therefore easier system to transition toward while offering 
what most organizations need which is more than enough.
